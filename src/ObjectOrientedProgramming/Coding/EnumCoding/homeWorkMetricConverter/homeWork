Create the MetricConverter enum class with constants :
 - KM_M
 - KM_CM
 - KM_MM
 - M_KM
 - M_CM
 - M_MM
 - CM_KM
 - CM_M
 - CM_MM
 - MM_K
 - MM_M
 - MM_CM
Enum should adopt a constructor that includes three parameters:
- input length unit
- output length unit
- the Converter interface instance (with a float convert(float lengthValueIn) method) the instance should define the necessary calculations for metric conversion

The MetricConverter enum class should adopt the static convertLengthUnits method which will include the following params:
- input length unit
- output length unit
- length value
This method should return the converted value. To find the right constant from set of enum values,
use the values() method.
